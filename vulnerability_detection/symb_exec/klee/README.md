# Tool for easily using **KLEE** on multiple sources  

## Usage
1. When running the commands below, you should be in the `klee/` directory.
2. Build the necessary docker images by running `./scripts/build_images.sh`.
3. Put all the sources inside the `sources` directory. Each source should be inside its own directory and the sources directory should look like this:
```
sources/
├── source1
│   └── source1.c
├── source2
│   └── source2.c
└── source3
    └── source3.c
```
4. Put all the executables in the `executables` directory. The executables directory should look like this:
```
executables/
├── exec1
├── exec2
└── exec3
```
5. Afterwards you just need to run `./scripts/docker-tool.sh one-run`. This will:
    a. Run retdec over all the executables and put the generated sources in the `sources` directory.
    b. Run KLEE over all the generated sources
    c. Gather all the results in the `results/` directory with the name `<source_name><test_name_and_run_id>.<error_type>.err.txt`.
6. Parameters for running KLEE can be configured in the `compose/.env` file.
