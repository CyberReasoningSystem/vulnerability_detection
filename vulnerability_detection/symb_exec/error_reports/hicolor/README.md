## HiColor - RetDec decompilation issues

### RetDec version used
```
RetDec version :  v5.0-15-g5821bbe7
Commit hash    :  5821bbe735262187bd5d48930d0eda8b7b48bba8
Build date     :  2023-04-26T07:36:05Z
```

### Codebase
- Clone repo: [https://github.com/dbohdan/hicolor](https://github.com/dbohdan/hicolor)
- Go to commit: `8ff464c3117b7eed7c248237c24b592d1e22ee27`
- Run `make`
- GCC version used for compiling the project: `gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0`

### Errors encountered
- Command run: `docker run --rm -v <absolute_path_to_hicolor_dir>:/destination retdec retdec-decompiler /destination/hicolor`
- Error generated:
```
Running phase: Unpacking ( 0.05s )
No matching plugins found for 'GCC 9.4.0'

[capstone2llvmir]: Missing type for register number: 242
```

### Troubleshooting attempts
- Tried compiling the code without debug flags and without optimizations
- Tried compiling the code with gcc-7 instead of gcc-9.4.0
- Tried compiling code without statically linking the binary
- The last step **solved** the issue with the `Missing type for register number: 242`
- Now the code generated by RetDec does not compile. It contains two errors:
    - `hicolor.c:25:8: error: redefinition of '_IO_FILE'`. This one is common,
        but it's easy to solve by removing the \_IO\_FILE structure redefined
        by RetDec, or renaming it to \_\_IO\_FILE, so that it is not in conflict
        with the structure defined in the standard C library
        - This also happens sometimes for other structures such as `struct timeval`, `struct timezone`, `struct tm`
    - `hicolor.c:2706:17: error: 'break' statement not in loop or switch statement`
