# Tool for easily using **KLEE** on multiple sources  

## Usage
1. Put all the sources inside the `sources` directory. Each source should be inside its own directory and the sources directory should look like this:
```
sources/
├── source1
│   └── source1.c
├── source2
│   └── source2.c
└── source3
    └── source3.c
```
2. Afterwards you just need to run `./scripts/docker-tool.sh one-run` and all the results will be displayed in `results/` with the name `<source_name><test_name_and_run_id>.txt`.
3. Parameters for running KLEE can be configured in the `compose/.env` file.
